### 2) Product Insertion {#2}
Insert your file by 'dragging' the product file into Roblox Studio with your game fully loaded. Use `CTRL + U` to ungroup the model.

### 3) Product Installation {#3}
Use the built in Roblox movement tools to position the inserted fire shutters and tools that come along with the product. Please remember to delete any unneeded ones!

:::warning

There are a number of reasons your shutters may not be working correctly. These include:
- The shutters colliding with parts (These may be invisible or unions with incorrect collisions)
- 'Join Surfaces' is enabled. This will weld your shutters to any parts they collide with whilst you are installing them.
- Using 3rd party movement tools such as 'Building Tools by F3X' have been known to break our doors during installation.

:::

### 4) Product Configuration {#4}
Please be aware there is only the one configuration file called "Config" and the shutters are in a folder called "Zones" (This may be a conflict folder if you have a fire alarm system installed in your Workspace) and you can edit the zones that the shutters are in there.
