:::warning

There are a number of reasons your doors may not be working correctly. These include:
- The doors colliding with parts (These may be invisible or unions with incorrect collisions)
- 'Join Surfaces' is enabled. This will weld your doors to any parts they collide with whilst you are installing them.
- Using 3rd party movement tools such as 'Building Tools by F3X' have been known to break our doors during installation.

### 4) Product Configuration {#4}
Please be aware there are 2 main configuration files, One named 'Settings' allowing for configuration of the door such as modes and speeds, With the 'PaxtonSettings' script allowing for configuration of the access control system.
