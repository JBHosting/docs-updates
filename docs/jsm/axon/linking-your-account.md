# Linking your Roblox account
To link your Roblox account, start by visiting our [Roblox Hub](https://www.roblox.com/games/13188104119). Towards the bottom right of your screen, you should be able to generate a code. Copy the full contents of the code you have received and run the slash command `/linkaccount [CODE]` owned by Axon in bot-commands.

:::caution

Do **not** share your code. This is unique to your own Roblox username. We use your code to link your Discord & Roblox account together, so anyone else who links with your code will not be our problem.
