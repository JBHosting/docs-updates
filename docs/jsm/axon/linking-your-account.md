# Linking your Roblox account
1. Start by visiting our [Roblox Hub](https://www.roblox.com/games/13188104119).
2. Towards the bottom right of your screen, generate a code by clicking 'generate'.
3. Copy the full contents of the unique code you have been given.
4. Move to our Discord server, and run the slash command `/linkaccount [CODE]` by Axon.
5. Wait for a response to confirm that you have been successfully verified.

:::caution

> Do **not** share your code. This is unique to your own Roblox account. We use your code to link your Discord & Roblox account together, so anyone else who links with your code will not be our problem.
