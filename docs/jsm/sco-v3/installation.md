# Installation

:::info

Download the recent available file for this product in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QVaxp9t). If you were using SCO v2 before SCO v3, it is important to note that the setup process has changed massively.

:::

:::note

This product comes with the **JSM SelfServ**, an ATM which can also work with the self-checkouts. You must own this side-product for the ATM to work, as it is not part of your SCO v3 purchase.

:::

### Step 1) Enable HTTP Requests {#1}
In Roblox studio with your selected game open, click the 'Home' tab, then 'Game Settings'. Move to the 'Security' tab in the open window and make sure the slider for 'Allow HTTP Requests' is enabled and then hit 'Save'.

### Step 2) Product Insertion {#2}
Insert your file by 'dragging' the product file into Roblox studio with your game fully loaded. Use `CTRL + U` to ungroup the model. You can delete anything relevant to the ATM if you do not own it.

### Step 3) Folder Movement {#3}
Move `JSM | ATM Tools`, `JSM | UI Template`, `Receipt`, `Debit Card` into ServerStorage.
