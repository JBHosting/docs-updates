# Themes

:::tip

We offer a couple of themes that have been integrated into the system for everyone. If you'd like to create your own theme to be public and contribute to the list, create a ticket inside our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QVaxp9t).

Themes may be removed from this list at any given time. We will automatically update your system to use the default UI if a theme has been removed.
