:::caution

You will need a licence to use AutoPro (Also found on Roblox)!

:::

### 1) Publish your game & enable HTTP Requests {#publish-http}
In Roblox Studio please publish your game by doing the following "File > Publish to Roblox (or Publish to Roblox as...)"

With your newly published game open, select the 'Home' tab, then 'Game Settings'. Move to the 'Security' tab in the open window and make sure the slider for 'Allow HTTP Requests' is enabled and then hit 'Save'.

### 2) Product Insertion {#product-insertion}

Insert your file by 'dragging' the product file, from your toolbox into your baseplate with your game fully loaded. This will add AutoPro to your game.

1. Ungroup the doors from the pack (press "Control + U" ONCE ONLY!)
2. Drag your doors to where you want them.
Please make sure your doors are NOT colliding with other parts as this will cause the doors to misbehave or not function at all

### 3) Door Configuration {#door-config}
First we will go over the "settings" script located under the main file structure of the AutoPro door(s).

![settingsfile](img/apmainsettings.png)
This is the "main settings" script

The settings script is pretty self explanitory but here is a table of what everything does

A lot of this script is out of the scope of this tutorial, we will only cover the basics of this file here.
